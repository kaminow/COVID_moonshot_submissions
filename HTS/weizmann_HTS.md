# Weizmann HTS

weizmann_HTS_900_hits_3X_validation.csv : single point validation of 900 hits from the primary screen that showed > 50% inhibition. Single point screening was performed 3 times so you have three lines per compound as well as the avg.

weizmann_HTS_128_mol_DR.csv and weizmann_HTS_128_mol_DR.xlsx : 128 compounds that were chosen for dose response (DR) validation. DR was repeated twice per compound. 

High Throughput Screening (HTS) of SARS-COV-2 Mpro
184,631 compounds from the G-INCPM screening collection as well as a ~3,000 Mpro targeted compound library from Enamine were screened against Mpro using a fluorogenic protease assay. A screening cascade was established as follows:  1) hits were defined as showing a greater than 50% inhibition were selected, filtered for obvious structural alerts and promiscuity in unrelated assays 2) 885 hits were re-tested in three independent Mpro assay runs to confirm activity 3) 128 confirmed hits in 5 concentrations were tested in  two independent  Mpro assay runs to determine preliminary potency as IC50. Promising compounds were re-sourced, and are awaiting validation. 
 
HTS was performed in both 384 well (20 µl) and 1536 well (10 µl, Greiner 782076) formats. Compounds were pre-plated into barcoded assay ready plates for a final concentration of 10 µM (0.1% DMSO). Assay was performed using Thermo combi dispensers with 1 µl tubing integrated with plate storage and BMG Pherastar FS plate reader and Spinnaker plate mover driven by Momentum software (Thermo). For 1536 well screening, plates were unloaded and spun for 1 min at 1500 RPM prior to plate reading.  Data was loaded to Screener software (Genedata) for mapping, normalization and annotation. Curated data was then loaded to CDD Vault for merging with compound annotations.
