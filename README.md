# COVID Moonshot Data

This repo contains all of the designs submitted to the [COVID Moonshot](https://covid.postera.ai/covid) project, as well as the initial experimental data created as part of the project.

The data has been split into many different folders and files, in order to ease the organization of such a large number of designs made through several CROs.

There exists one "master file" containing most of the non-experimental information: [covid_submissions_all_info.csv](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/blob/master/covid_submissions_all_info.csv) This file is described in much greater detail at the end of this README.

There also exist several folders:
- [data_for_CDD/](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/tree/master/data_for_CDD): prepares the data in a format suitable for upload to the CDD (Collaborative Drug Discovery) vault
- [experimental_data/](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/tree/master/experimental_data): data resulting from assays on the ordered compounds.
- [orders_data/](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions): The compounds that have been ordered up to this point.
- [shipments_data/](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/tree/master/shipments_data) the compounds that have been recevied up to this point.

## Assay Details ##

### Fluorescence MPro assay: ###

Compounds were seeded into assay-ready plates (Greiner 384 low volume 784900) using an Echo 555 acoustic dispenser, and DMSO was back-filled for a uniform concentration in assay plates (maximum 1%). Screening assays were performed in duplicate at 20 µM and 50 µM. Hits of greater than 50% inhibition at 50 µM were confirmed by dose response assays. Reagents for Mpro assay reagents were dispensed into the assay plate in 10 µl volumes for a final of 20 µl. Final reaction concentrations were 20 mM HEPES pH=7.3, 1mM TCEP, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 5 nM Mpro, 375 nM fluorogenic peptide substrate ([5-FAM]-AVLQSGFR-[Lys(Dabcyl)]-K-amide). Mpro was pre-incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature with compound before addition of substrate. Protease reaction was measured continuously in a BMG Pherastar FS with a 480/520 ex/em filter set.

### RapidFire MPro assay: ###

Inhibitor compounds are dispensed into 384-well plates using the ECHO dispenser (DMSO concentration < 1%). Enzyme solution, containing 20 nM Mpro, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 50 mM NaCl, is added to each well and incubated with the inhibitor for 15 min at RT. The reaction is initiated with the addition of 2.0 μM substrate (TSAVLQSGFRK, custom synthesized in Schofield group). After 10 min the reaction is quenched with 10% formic acid and injected into an Agilent RapidFire LC-MS system. Data analysis are done with PRISM and CDD.  All compounds are triaged by testing calculating the % inhibition at 5 and 50 μM final concentration.  Dose response curves are done with 11 datapoints range of 100 – 0.0017 μM inhibitor.

### High-throughput solubility threshold measurement ###

Nephelometry-based solubility assay to define threshold compound solubility at the concentrations of 20 µM and 100 µM in PBS solution. The compound solubilities are normalized to Deoxyfluorouridine (100% soluble) and ondansetron (0% solubility).

To put the numbers in perspective, the expected relative solubility values are:
- High >0.8
- Mid 0.6-0.8
- Low <0.6

To perform the screening, 245 µL aliquots of PBS buffer were added to each well of 96-well
microplates with clear flat bottom. Plates with the buffer were subjected to optical integrity
inspection using Nephelostar. Total scanning time for one 96-well plate was 3 min.

The pass criterion was set as the background signal in any of the scanned wells below 25 RNU, thus making optical quality of the plates satisfactory for the assay. In case of an excessively high background signal in any wells of the test-plates, those plates/wells were excluded from the study (data not shown).

Compounds were obtained from Enamine repository as solids formatted in polypropylene, round
bottom blank tubes, in latch boxes (Matrix #4271). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at
50 mM, incubated at 24-26°C for 8 hours, shaken for 1 hour at 1800 rpm using high-speed
microplate shaker Illumina, then incubated at 24-26°C for 14 hours. Intermediate DMSO solutions
of the tested compounds were prepared to 2 mM (for the tested concentration 20 µM) and 8 mM
(for the tested concentration 100 µM). Ondansetron and DOFU were added to the final plates in
100 mM concentration to get 1 mM and 2 mM final concentrations in the assay plates.

To prepare the test plates, 2.5µL aliquots of DMSO solutions of the tested compounds, reference
compounds or pure DMSO were transferred from the polypropylene tubes to the corresponding
wells of 96-well plates with PBS buffer using Plate Mate, according to the plate map (Fig. 1). Thus, final volumes in the test plates were brought to 247.5 µL, resulting in concentrations of the compounds in test wells of 20 µM and 1% DMSO, correspondingly. Then, turbidity of the solutions was immediately scanned for each well.
